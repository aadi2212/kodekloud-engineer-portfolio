Git Merge Branches



1]

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/news.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:





Create a new branch xfusion in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

Steps to Complete the Task:

1]Log in to the Storage Server.

&nbsp;ssh natasha@172.16.238.15



2]Navigate to the repository.

&nbsp;sudo cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news



3]Ensure repo is trusted (fix for dubious ownership, if needed).

git config --global --add safe.directory /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news



4]Switch to master branch

&nbsp;sudo git checkout master

&nbsp;sudo git pull origin master



5]Create and switch to new branch xfusion

git checkout -b xfusion



6]Copy the file into the repo

&nbsp;sudo cp /tmp/index.html .



7]Verify:

ls -l index.html



8]Stage and commit the file

sudo git add index.html

sudo git commit -m "Added index.html file in xfusion branch"



9]Push the new branch to origin

git push origin xfusion



10]Switch back to master branch

git checkout master



11]Merge xfusion branch into master

git merge xfusion



12]Push updated master to origin

git push origin master





âœ… Final Verification

Check branches:

git branch -a



\* master

&nbsp; xfusion

&nbsp; remotes/origin/master

&nbsp; remotes/origin/xfusion
