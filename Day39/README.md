docker ps

Confirmed ubuntu\_latest container was running.

3]Verified the new image:

docker images

REPOSITORY   TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

games        datacenter   ff6f25964b13   6 seconds ago   132MB

ubuntu       latest       802541663949   3 weeks ago     78.1MB



Confirmed games:datacenter was listed among available images.
