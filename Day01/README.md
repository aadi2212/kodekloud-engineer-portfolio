üõ† Step-by-Step Instructions



1Ô∏è‚É£ SSH into App Server 3

&nbsp;ssh banner@172.16.238.12

&nbsp;pass-BigGr33n



2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the User siva with Non-Interactive Shell

Use the /sbin/nologin shell depending on your system



&nbsp;sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin siva 



‚úÖ This prevents siva from logging into the system interactively.

You can verify the shell path available on your server using:



&nbsp;getent  passwd siva



siva:x:1001:1001::/home/siva:/sbin/nologin



&nbsp;  cat /etc/shells



3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify User and Shell



&nbsp;grep siva /etc/passwd 



Expected output-



siva:x:1001:1001::/home/siva:/sbin/nologin

üéØ Objective

To support the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries has requested the creation of a non-login service account:



‚Ä¢ Create a user named siva on App Server 3.

‚Ä¢ The user should have no interactive login shell.





üìå Notes:
