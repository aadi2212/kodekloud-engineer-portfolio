Install Docker Packages and Start Docker Service



1]

The Nautilus DevOps team aims to containerize various applications following a recent meeting with the application development team. They intend to conduct testing with the following steps:

&nbsp;	1. Install docker-ce and docker compose packages on App Server 3.

&nbsp;	2. Initiate the docker service.

ðŸ“„ Task Documentation: Docker \& Docker Compose Installation on App Server 3



Objective:



1]Install Docker CE and Docker Compose on App Server 3.

2]Start and enable the Docker service.

3]Test that Docker and Docker Compose are functioning correctly.



Steps Performed:



1]Install Docker CE



sudo yum install -y yum-utils

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io



2]Install Docker Compose



Option 1: Using package manager

sudo yum install -y docker-compose   





But its not worked I used another option





Option 2: Using Docker Compose official binary

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.27.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose



sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose



docker-compose --version



3]Start and Enable Docker Service

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl enable docker

sudo systemctl status docker



start â†’ start Docker immediately

enable â†’ ensure Docker starts on system boot

status â†’ verify Docker is active and running



4]Test Docker installation

docker version                             # Check Docker engine version

docker info                                   # Check Docker daemon info 

docker run hello-world              # Test running a container



Successful hello-world container run confirms Docker is working properly.

Docker Compose version check confirms Compose installation.



âœ… Notes / Observations

Always ensure Docker service is running before using Docker Compose.

Use the official binary if the package manager version of Docker Compose is outdated.

This setup prepares App Server 3 for containerizing applications as per DevOps requirements.
